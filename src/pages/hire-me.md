# Hire Me

Through experience in contract opportunities and open source work I've come to
realize I love to **optimize developer experience** (DX) in JavaScript and
TypeScript projects.

If developers prioritize new features and bug fixes, they often suffer from:

- Complicated onboarding and development setups
- Large and muddy code repositories (tech debt, anyone?)
- Lengthy feedback loops (like slow tests)
- Slow tooling and unoptimized configurations

If your team ticks any of these boxes, I can help!

Waiting and context shifts carry significant hidden costs. This adds up faster
than you might think, so the ROI of better automation is high.

Leading by example, I can automate daily tasks, install better tooling, write
guides and documentation, and build new tools as we go. My goal is always to
make myself redundant.

In short: I enable developers to be more productive, leading to reduced costs
and increased happiness.

Feel free to [contact me][1] and discuss ideas. Just starting up or rolling
smoothly? Challenging frontend development and architecture opportunities are
still welcome!
