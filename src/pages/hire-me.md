# Hire Me

Through experience in contract opportunities and open source work I've come to
realize I love to **optimize developer experience** (DX) in JavaScript and
TypeScript projects.

If developers prioritize new features and bug fixes, they often suffer from:

- Complicated onboarding and development setups
- Large and muddy code repositories (tech debt)
- Lengthy feedback loops (slow builds and tests)
- Slow tooling and unoptimized configurations

If your team ticks any of these boxes, I can help.

Waiting and context shifting carry significant hidden costs. This adds up faster
than you might think, so automation pays off.

In short: I love building and implementing tools to make teams and developers
more effective, leading to reduced costs and increased happiness!

Feel free to [contact me][1] and discuss ideas.

Challenging frontend development and architecture opportunities are still
welcome!
