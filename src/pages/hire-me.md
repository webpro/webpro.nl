# Hire Me

...as a Frontend Architect or Tooling Engineer.

Got an exciting project? [Letâ€™s have a chat][1] to discuss your ideas and my
availability.

## Frontend Architect

In the industry for well over 20 years, having seen lots of technology
implemented well and poorly, I love to help out in areas like:

- Design and implement frontend platforms that scale
- Performance review and strategies to improve
- Unbiased review of current processes and frontend tech

## Tooling Engineer

Through experience in contract opportunities and open source work I've come to
realize I love to **optimize developer experience** (DX) in JavaScript and
TypeScript projects.

If developers prioritize new features and bug fixes, they often suffer from:

- Complicated onboarding and development setups
- Large and muddy code repositories (entropy/tech debt)
- Lengthy feedback loops (slow tests and builds)
- Slow tooling and unoptimized configurations

If your team ticks any of these boxes, I can help.

Waiting and context shifting carry significant hidden costs. This adds up faster
than you might think, so optimization and automation pays off.

In short: I love building and implementing tools to make teams and developers
more effective, leading to reduced costs and increased happiness!

Feel free to [contact me][1] and discuss ideas.
