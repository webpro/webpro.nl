# Versioned documentation with Starlight & Vercel

## Introduction

Let's say in our project we're working on a new major version. This may come
with new features or even breaking changes. Users that did not upgrade yet
reading documentation for the new version might get confused. This is why we
want to serve a separate version of the documentation along with each major
version of our project.

## A Temporary Solution

Using Starlight and Vercel, this quick guide shows how I did it in my own
project: serve a separate version of the documentation at its own path. We're
assuming the documentation is deployed from the `main` branch (still at v1) and
we're working in the `v2` branch to prepare the next major release. We're going
to deploy this version branch and make it accessible at the `/v2` path of a
domain we already own.

This solution requires a separate Vercel project for each major version.

Hopefully the Starlight team will deliver a [built-in solution][1], but until
then this approach might work for you if you need it.

## The Plan

This guide assumes we have our site (`example.org`) running, and want to add the
next version at `example.org/v2`.

We start by setting up a new versioned project, make sure it works, and then
integrate the main project with it. It's a short story in three parts:

1. Set `base` and `outDir` options for Starlight in the versioned branch.
2. Create a new project in Vercel and deploy this versioned branch.
3. Configure `rewrites` for Vercel in the `main` branch.

## Configure the versioned branch

Create or switch to the version branch, `v2` in our example.

In your Astro configuration, set both the `base` and the `outDir` to match the
version in the current branch:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://example.org',
  base: '/v2',
  outDir: './dist/v2',
  trailingSlash: 'never',
});
```

This example has trailing slashes removed, which makes sense with Vercel's
`cleanUrls` option we'll set later on. The example site is using the default
`static` output.

Now is the time to verify a local `astro dev` serves the site at the `/v2` path
properly and links are working fine. Push your version branch to your Git
remote. Make sure not to merge these changes to the `main` branch.

## Create a new project in Vercel

Create a new project in the Vercel control panel and connect it with your Git
repository. It makes sense to name the project after the version, something like
"example-org-v2".

Go to _Settings â†’ Git â†’ Production Branch_ to set the version branch:

![production-branch-name][2]

In the screenshots we see "v4", because I was at v3 in the `main` branch.

No need to buy or connect a new domain, versioned docs can be served from a free
Vercel subdomain such as `example-org-v2.vercel.app`. No worries: users won't
see this, they will only see the main domain you've already set up.

Go to _Settings â†’ Domains_, edit and double-check it does not have redirects
configured and that the Git branch is `v2`:

![domains][3]

Verify the site is deployed and working at the Vercel domain and version path
(our example would run at `https://example-org-v2.vercel.app/v2`).

Need to trigger a deployment? Go to `Settings â†’ Git â†’ Deploy Hooks`:

![hooks][4]

You can copy the link and use `curl` in a shell to trigger a deployment:

```shell
curl https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/prj_rKtw..
```

Once your versioned site is running smoothly we're ready for the final step!

## Configure rewrites for Vercel

Switch to the `main` branch and create a `vercel.json` file in the same folder
as `astro.config.mjs` (if it isn't already there). Add two items to the
`rewrites` array as follows:

```json
{
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/v2/:path*",
      "destination": "https://example-org-v2.vercel.app/v2/:path*"
    },
    {
      "source": "/v1/:path*",
      "destination": "/:path*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Modify the domain and the paths to match your situation. In this example, `v1`
is still the default version. You can basically swap them around once `v2` is
the new default in the main branch. You'll want to omit the `cleanUrls` if you
prefer trailing slashes.

Push this in the `main` branch to the remote and wait for the deployment to
finish. Verify everything works as expected: `example.org` , `example.org/v1`
and `example.org/v2`.

Awesome! ðŸŽ‰

We've completed all steps and this process can be repeated for new versions in
the future.

## Navigation

What's left to do is to show the user the current version of the documentation
and a way to navigate to a different version. There's multiple ways to do this,
so this is left as an exercise to the reader.

Feel free to check out my basic solution using a dropdown in [a custom
`Header.astro` component][5] with [minimal configuration][6] to keep track of
available versions. The repo contains the `astro.config.ts` and `vercel.json`
configuration files in the `main` branch too. This solution is currently running
at [https://knip.dev][7].

Good luck and have a great day!
