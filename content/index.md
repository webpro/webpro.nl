Hi, my name is Lars Kappert, an independent full-stack architect and developer.
My current role is frontend tech lead.

In this industry for over 20 years, I like to think I know my way around in
frontend architecture and development. Solving problems with (mostly)
JavaScript, Node.js and React. I care about performance, developer experience
and open source.

Always interested in exciting and challenging contract-based projects in the
Utrecht area, or remote.

How can I help you?
